Lab1: Object-oriented Programming

PURPOSE: 
•	learn to work with multiple classes

Description:
In this assignment, please write a program that provides a way for you to manage class roster (search only). Design a user interface that provides the following operations. 
•	Display the student information for a specified ID, including student id, scores of CLA, OLA, Quiz, Homework, Exam, and Bonus. Prompt for student ID.
•	Display information of all students in the class. 
•	Quit the program.
Student records are saved in the file point.dat. You can proceed as follows:
•	Design and implement the class Student, which represents ID, score information of a student. You will store instances of this class in the Roster class.
•	Design and implement the class Roster, which represents class roster and provides approaches to manage the roster. 
Skeleton header files for Student and Roster are provided. In skeleton files, all member data and some functions are defined. However, predefined functions may be not enough. Additional functions may be required to accomplish the task.
Assignment Objectives:
This assignment provides experience in the new programming paradigm -- object-oriented programming. In other words, you need to design classes with an appropriate interface (i.e. the set of public functions), and make them work together to accomplish the specified task. Additionally, this assignment provides experience in compilation of multiple source files by using make command. 

Requirements
1)	You are required to use C++ classes for this program.  You should have a “Student” class, and a “Roster” class. Header files for these classes are provided by the instructor. It is not necessary to modify the provided header files.

2)	Output for this program must clearly and neatly show that the program does work and that it works correctly.  

3)	The files you need to submit are: Student.h, Student.cpp, Roster.h, Roster.cpp, and ola1.cpp. 


How to download assignment files:
Go to the URL: http://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~zdong/3110/public/OLA/ and download the file OLA1.zip, which contains the following files:
•	OLA1Description.doc: this file
•	OLA1Rubric.doc: a rubric used to grade this assignment
•	OLA1.exe: an executable solution provided by the instructor.
•	Roster.h: the header for the class Roster.
•	Student.h: the header for the class Student.

How to submit your Lab:
o	softcopy: 
♣	Use SVN to submit your project. Make sure your  repository has a folder for each project.
♣	Any commit of the project after the deadline is considered as cheating. If this happens, the latest version before the deadline will be graded, and you may receive up to 50 points deduction.

o	Hard copy:
♣	print all source files 
♣	Enclose the hardcopy of the program and the rubric in a folder (at least 9''x12''), and put C# (the one I give you), your name, section #, instructor name on the folder. (Note: You can buy folders from computer lab.)
